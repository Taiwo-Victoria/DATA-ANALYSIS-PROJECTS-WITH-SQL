## Analyzing Students' Mental Health in SQL

###### In this project, we'll perform exploratory data analysis on a dataset around the mental health of domestic and international students. We'll perform SQL querying to examine how social connectedness and cultural issues affect mental health. Finally, we'll visualize the results of your analysis using the Python Plotly package.

## The Data

This survey was conducted in 2018 at an international Japanese university, and the associated study was published in 2019. Several ethical and regulatory boards approved it.

The study found that international students have a higher risk of mental health difficulties compared to the general population and that social connectedness and acculturative stress are predictive of depression.

Social connectedness: the measure of belonging to a social group or network.

Acculturative stress: stress associated with learning about and integrating into a new culture.
